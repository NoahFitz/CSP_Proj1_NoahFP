If the only issue with this method of approximation is the width of the $\Delta\theta$ interval, than it should work
fine with a more powerful computer. If, however, it is a more fundamental issue with the method which was somehow
overlooked, more work will need to be done. Based on this project alone, it at least seems that Kepler's laws were
effectivley formatted into equations of velocity capable of being computed quickly and accurately. Formulas that
could integrate the velocity equation directly could be used to better analyze the error of this method.
